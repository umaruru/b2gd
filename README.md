# B2GD: Blender to Godot

**B2GD** is a Blender to Godot plugin. It allows to set Godot properties directly
inside Blender, create colliders, navigation and occluders, replace an object with
a scene, etc.

The plugin contains two parts: a Godot plugin and a Blender extension. The Godot plugin
was built with version 4.4. The Blender extension was built with version 4.4, but
should work on versions 4.2+ (not tested yet).

The Godot plugin is licensed under the MIT License.
The Blender extension is licensed under GNU GPLv3 or later, as
[required by Blender](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/advanced/extensions/licenses.html).

This project is a work in progress! Docs, examples and the first release are being
made and will be released when they're ready.
