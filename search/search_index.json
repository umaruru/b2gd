The suffixes are a quick way to create collisions, navigation and other stuff. They can be applied en masse with batch renamer. But they lack customization. B2GD was created to give more control of the scene. Changing properties directly on blender means less back and forth between programs. Another thing is, with suffixes, it seems only the last one is applied. B2GD can generate collider, navigation and occlusion from a single mesh. You can use suffixes with B2GD, but the output scene might be unexpected. My properties aren't being imported. Make sure you enabled Include > Custom Properties in the gltf export settings. You can use the button at the top of B2GD Panel to enable it. Read Blender Export Settings . Warning TODO: Actually I have to test this. What is the b2gd_data__ I'm seeing everywhere? b2gd_data__ is the chosen name for the property where B2GD stuff is stored. You can see it in Blender on the object's custom properties. Scenes in Blender also gain a b2gd_data__ property. This was necessary to avoid creating a b2gd_data__ property in all objects, even if it was not being used. The property on the scene is used as a \"bridge\" to the object property. Setters and getters are in place to set the data directly in the object. Planned features There are things to be done and fixed in the current feature set. But there are some features I'd like to add to the plugin: Path3D from Curve . Save the bezier curve data and recreate as a Path3D. More navigation . Add more navigation stuff, like creating obstacles, links and setting agent properties. Multimesh . Not exactly how it can be done, but have a way take data (vertices, empties, or something else) and create a MultiMeshInstance with it. Primitive collision shapes . Create Godot's primitive collision shapes, like Box, Sphere, Capsule, etc. TODO: add list of properties","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"faq/#faq","text":"","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"faq/#why-use-b2gd-instead-of-suffixes","text":"The suffixes are a quick way to create collisions, navigation and other stuff.

These properties are read in Godot during the import process and nodes are configured accordingly. Blender doesn't export custom properties by default. You have to enable it on the GLTF export settings. Go to File > Export > glTF 2.0 (.glb/.gltf). On the right panel, expand \"Include\" and check \"Custom Properties\". You may want to check \"Remember Export Settings\" so you won't need to do the steps above everytime you open the file. Remembering settings is required when using blend files in your project instead of gltf. By the way, export settings are file based. You have to do the steps above in every different file. Tip A button was added at the top of the B2GD panel to enable Custom Properties on the GLTF Export Settings.

Geometry options This mode allows to set Node properties to Mesh objects, as well as creating collider, navigation region and occluder. Mesh Instance The Mesh checkbox allows to set VisualInstance3D and GeometryInstance3D properties. It is enabled by default. It can be disabled when a MeshInstance3D is not needed, but collision, navigation or occluder are. When disabled, the property Remove Mode becomes available, where you can choose between: Remove by Node3D : The MeshInstance3D is replaced by a Node3D. Children are kept. Free Node : The MeshInstance3D and its children are removed.
